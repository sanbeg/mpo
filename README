Open source utils to work with .mpo files; currently tested with files from
the Fujifilm FinePix 3DW3

It seems there are very few open source tools to work with this format.

Currently, this is a program to extract the individual images from this file.  

There is already some quick & dirty code out there that guesses at
boundaries by looking for a certain byte sequence, to produce something
that's close enough to a valid jpeg that most image readers can handle it.
This code follows the JPEG specification to extract the images and produce
perfectly valid JPEG images.  This code also strips the MPF blocks, which
aren't relevant in .jpg files, to produce output closer to what the camera
produces; I may add functionality to strip the multi-picture Exif tags as
well, which would allow producing .jpg files that are identical to what the
camera produces.
